This repository was created with the intention to store some programming tools I have programmed to use and facilitate enginnering processes. 
For now, in this repository, there is:
1 - Matrix scaling tool: 
    - The code has almost 300 lines and can scale any matrix by Gaussian Elimination;
    - Shows the unique solution, if it has infinite solutions (and the equation with the variables) or if it does not have solutions;
    - It makes a step-by-step process (not explicity but there's a way to understand the process);
    - For clarification, it has application to every problem involving a system of linear equations.
