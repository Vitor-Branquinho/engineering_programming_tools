### 1. Matrix Scaling Tool

This tool is designed to scale matrices using **Gaussian Elimination**. Below are the key features:

- **Matrix Scaling**: The code can scale any matrix, solving systems of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination.
- **Solution Details**:
  - Displays the unique solution when one exists.
  - Identifies when there are infinite solutions and provides the equation with the variables.
  - Indicates when there is no solution to the system.
- **Step-by-Step Process**: While the steps arenâ€™t explicitly printed, the code follows a process that can be easily understood to track the elimination steps.
  
This tool can be applied to any problem involving systems of linear equations, making it a valuable resource for engineering-related problems.
